# App name: To-Do List
##### By: Daniel Oliemans, University of Amsterdam

## App Description:

In this app, you can make your own to-do list. You can create to-do lists by adding them in the textfield at the bottom of the page. After creating a category, you can add to-dos in that category.
You can also easily delete to-do list items by long-clicking the collumn you want to be deleted.
